#### welcome to our chef-master recipe site
- First created Navbar and Footer


- Then I added a background image to the Home Section, wrote a heading on it and wrote   some details about the website


- Then we did the work of the server, for example, from Express js, we first create a folder for the server with Mkdir, then we go inside that folder and do Index.js file Khule Express require, we do some work there, then we create data of Chef for Chef's Card. I have sent


- With the link of the data we sent to the localhost, we map the data and show All Chef card through UseEffect.
Then Chef er details show all the details in the card.



- If you click on the View Recipe button inside the Chef card, it will show us the complete details of the chef and his recipes. We have loaded the data from the server and then shown the details in the recipe.


- After that, we created a Frequently Asked Question Section on the Home Page of All Chef and inside it we wrote a question and wrote the answer to it. We wrote a Feedback Form on that form and it will come directly to me.


- Then we create file in Firebase, then we set everything in Firebase, we take the codes of Firebase and Firebase. Paste config.js. After that we put them in environment variable.

Then we protect that chef's details and recipe route with private route, in which if I am not logged in, then I am logged in and shown his details and chef's recipe. We have created AuthProvider File and Private Route for Authentication.
